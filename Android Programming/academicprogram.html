<br>
Special Examinations are scheduled three (3) school days after the last day of the scheduled examination.<br>
Examination permit is required of any student going to take the Special Examination.<br>

While the teachers do the checking of the test papers, these are returned to the students for post-checking review and clarification.<br>
Examination permits of students without financial obligation for the Quarter are released by the Cashier to the department secretary who turns these over to the Academic Coordinator. From the Academic Coordinator, the Examination permits are given to the year level Chairman who finally gives these to the Class Adviser for distribution to the concerned students.<br>
<br>
Examination permits are immediately released as soon as students/ parents/ guardians settle their obligations within the week before the examination.<br>

<h3>THE GRADING SYSTEM</h3><br>
</center>
<div class="w3-container w3-card-4 w3-white">
<p style="text-align:justify">
The grading system follows the Averaging System where the FINAL GRADE of each subject is the AVERAGE of the grades of the four quarters.<br>
<br>
Each subject has required points considering the curricular requirements that the students need to meet. The highest possible grade is 100% and the lowest is 70%.<br>
<br>

<b>COMPUTING THE SUBJECT GRADE</b><br>
<br>
The subject grade is based on the components and the corresponding percentages. It is interesting to note that the different subjects have different percentages for the components. This is so because each subject has a unique nature.<br>
<br>
In computing the EQUIVALENT, the RAW SCORE shall be divided by the PERFECT SCORE; then multiplied by 50 and added with 50.<br>
<br>

Christian Living Quiz example;<br>
<br>
Perfect Score  = 150<br>
Raw Score = 109<br>
